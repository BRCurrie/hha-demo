I spent more than 4 hours on this because I wanted to showcase my understanding of Angular and best practices. I did waste a little time calling for "period=2015" from the API however the JSON was not return as an array and the implementation was unpleasant, so I switched back to filtering the data in the service client side. Some of the components could easily have been made into reusable components and moved from the dashboard and into the shared module with some generic naming and a little logic implemented ( like only display 5 properties of an object ). Styling is minimal, but I have included Angular Material and bootstrap into this project. A lot of the typical styling from material is put into things like headers, buttons, etc. so the theming isn't exactly showcased. I did not implement testing into this project. I am still an inexperienced developer so it takes me some time to setup and implement test cases. I do understand that TDD is an important part of enterprise applications and I am working towards using this method in my own projects. I am also working to better understanding Jasmine and Jest so that I can develop better applications. If you look at my portfolio I have a project with more testing implemented, as well as a custom theme built with Angular Material.
